# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones – Tidy Data Project

## Overview

This project processes the **UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset** to create a tidy data set that contains the **average of each measurement for each activity and each subject**.

The script downloads the raw data, merges training and test sets, extracts relevant measurements, applies descriptive labels, and outputs a clean summary data file.

## Dataset Source

Original dataset:
📎 [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones)

The data were collected from the accelerometers and gyroscopes of Samsung Galaxy S smartphones worn by 30 subjects performing six activities.

## Requirements

* R (version ≥ 4.0 recommended)
* Package:

  ```r
  install.packages("dplyr")
  ```

---

## How to Run the Script

1. Place the script in your working directory.
2. Open R or RStudio.
3. Run:

```r
source("run_analysis.R")
```

The script will:

* Download and unzip the dataset (if not already present)
* Process the data
* Create `final_data.txt` in your working directory

---

## What the Script Does

### 1. Loads Libraries

Uses `dplyr` for data manipulation.

### 2. Downloads and Reads Data

* Downloads the UCI HAR Dataset if not already present
* Reads:

  * Feature names
  * Activity labels
  * Subject IDs
  * Training and test measurement data

### 3. Merges Datasets

* Combines training and test sets into one data frame
* Adds subject IDs and activity codes

### 4. Extracts Mean and Standard Deviation Measurements

* Selects only variables containing `mean` or `std`

### 5. Applies Descriptive Activity Names

* Replaces numeric activity codes with descriptive labels such as:

  * WALKING
  * SITTING
  * STANDING

### 6. Labels Variables with Descriptive Names

* Expands abbreviations and improves readability:

  * `Acc` → `Accelerometer`
  * `Gyro` → `Gyroscope`
  * `t` → `Time`
  * `f` → `Frequency`
  * `mean()` → `Mean`
  * `std()` → `STD`

### 7. Creates Final Tidy Dataset

* Groups by:

  * `subjects`
  * `activity`
* Computes the **mean of each variable**
* Writes the output to:

```
final_data.txt
```

---

## Output File: `final_data.txt`

* Each row represents a unique **subject–activity pair**
* Each column contains the **average** of a measurement variable
* Data format: space-delimited text file

Example structure:

```
subjects activity TimeBodyAccelerometerMeanX TimeBodyAccelerometerMeanY ...
1 WALKING 0.27733 -0.01738 ...
1 SITTING 0.26124 -0.00131 ...
```

## Tidy Data Principles Followed

✔ One variable per column
✔ One observation per row
✔ Descriptive variable names
✔ No duplicated or ambiguous labels
